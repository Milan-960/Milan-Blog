Milan Sachani, a passionate software developer working at Spryr. I specialize in building web applications using modern technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, **Svelte**, **Node.js** and **Nestjs**. My journey in programming has been exciting and ever-evolving. 🧑‍💻

### My Story

I fell in love with programming, and I believe it’s a journey that never truly ends. 😎 At the very least, I've learned something new every day, and that keeps me motivated to grow. As a **Software Engineer**, I work on a variety of projects, from building scalable web apps to solving business problems with innovative products.

I enjoy researching new trends and learning about cutting-edge technologies. Whether it's working with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Vite**, or **Node.js**, I love being at the forefront of web development.

Feel free to contact me if you need **consulting**, **volunteer work**, or just want to talk about something interesting. I’m always excited to collaborate on new projects or exchange ideas!

### Areas of Interest
