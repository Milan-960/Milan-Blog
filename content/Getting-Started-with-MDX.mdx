# Getting Started with MDX

![MDX Header Image](https://st4.depositphotos.com/1038076/26541/i/450/depositphotos_265419430-stock-photo-lets-get-started.jpg)

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your Markdown files, giving you the ability to create more dynamic and interactive blog posts. In this post, we'll explore how to use MDX in your Next.js blog and demonstrate how to add images, videos, and code snippets to your posts.

## Headings in MDX

MDX supports Markdown-style headings. For example, this section is an H2 heading, and below is an H4 heading:

#### This is an H4 Heading

You can also use other Markdown features like lists and formatting.

---

### Text Formatting

MDX supports common Markdown formatting such as **bold** and _italic_ text.  
You can also combine these to create bold and italic text like **_this_**.

---

### Lists in MDX

You can easily create lists in MDX:

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

---

## Adding Images to MDX

Here’s an example of how to include an image in your MDX content. MDX allows you to directly reference images from a URL, and they will be rendered using Next.js's `next/image` component for optimized performance.

This image demonstrates how to integrate an external image URL. You can also use local images from your project folder.

## Adding Videos to MDX

You can also embed videos directly in your MDX content using the `<video>` HTML tag. Here's an example of a video being embedded in the blog post:

<video src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4" width="800" controls />

This video demonstrates the basics of HTML video embedding.

## Writing Code in MDX

MDX is great for developers who want to write code snippets in their blog posts. Here’s an example of how to include a JavaScript code block:

```javascript
const helloWorld = () => {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
};
```
